## Why do I want a POOR file system?
Currently, we tend to structure our file systems similarly to a Physical cabinet:
* Drawer (Permission)
* Folder (Bucket)
* File (Object)
Object-Oriented typing and inheritance patterns brought us entity classification:
* Mapping (Synonym)
* Enumeration (Children)
* Composite (Components)
Machine learning, like the human brain, works best with associative Relations:
* Resembles (Like)
* Contiguous (Near)
* Causes (Sequence)

### A POOR file system works on all 9 relations
