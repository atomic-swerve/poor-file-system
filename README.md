# POOR file system
TBD

## WTF is a POOR file system?
My attempt to reconcile a few different methods of representing information that are all correct yet entirely incompatible.

## Who even are you?
I'm Piers! I have some ideas about systems thinking that need a little tooling to test out.

## You didn't answer my first question.
Be more specific.

POOR is an acronynm for **Physical/Object-Oriented/Relational**, which are the three data-defining dogmas I believe can be integrated in a single software system. I have identified three key relations from each model that need to be implemented for a system to be considered POOR.

## So there are nine relations? Can I have some examples?
We tend to structure our file systems similarly to a **Physical** cabinet:
* Drawer *(Permission)*
* Folder *(Location)*
* File *(Object)*

**Object-Oriented** patterns allow systems with more symbolic classification:
* Mapping *(Synonym)*
* Enumeration *(Children)*
* Composite *(Components)*

Machine learning, like the human brain, works best with associative **Relations**:
* Resembles *(Like)*
* Contiguous *(Near)*
* Causes *(Sequence)*

### A POOR file system works on all 9 relations to provide human, machine, and system entity organization.
Any questions? Make an issue. Thanks!
